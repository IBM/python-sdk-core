# python-sdk-core
This project contains the core functionality used by Python SDK's generated by the IBM OpenAPI 3 SDK Generator (openapi-sdkgen).
Python code generated by openapi-sdkgen will depend on the function contained in this project.

## Installation

To install, use `pip` or `easy_install`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade ibm-cloud-sdk-core
```

or

```bash
easy_install --upgrade ibm-cloud-sdk-core
```

## Authentication Types
There are several flavors of authentication supported in this package. To specify the intended authentication pattern to use, simply instantiate the `Authenticator` of your choice.

### Basic
This indicates Basic Auth is to be used. Users will pass in a `username` and `password` and the SDK will generate a Basic Auth header to send with requests to the service.

```py
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import BasicAuthenticator

authenticator = BasicAuthenticator(<your_username>, <your_password>)
```

### IAM
This indicates that IAM token authentication is to be used. Users can pass in a `apikey` and the SDK will generate a Bearer Auth header to send with requests to the service.

```py
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator

authenticator = IAMAuthenticator(<your_apikey>)
```

### Cloud Pak for Data
This indicates that the service is an instance of CP4D, which has its own version of token authentication. Users can pass in a `username`, `password` and `url`, and the SDK will generate a Bearer Auth header to send with requests to the service.

```py
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import CloudPakForDataAuthenticator

authenticator = CloudPakForDataAuthenticator(<your_username>, <your_password>, <your_url>)
```

### Bearer Token
This indicates bearer token authentication is to be used. The system would prepend the `bearer` name to your token and add it to the authorization header.

```py
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import BearerTokenAuthenticator

authenticator = BearerTokenAuthenticator(<your_bearer_token>)
```

### No Authentication
This indicates that no authentication is needed when sending requests to the service

```py
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import NoAuthAuthenticator

authenticator = NoAuthAuthenticator()
```

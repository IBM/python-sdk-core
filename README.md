# python-sdk-core
This project contains the core functionality used by Python SDK's generated by the IBM OpenAPI 3 SDK Generator (openapi-sdkgen).
Python code generated by openapi-sdkgen will depend on the function contained in this project.

# Notice
Support for Python versions 2.x and versions <= 3.4 is deprecated and will be officially dropped in the next major release, which is expected to be end of September, 2019.

## Installation

To install, use `pip` or `easy_install`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade ibm-cloud-sdk-core
```

or

```bash
easy_install --upgrade ibm-cloud-sdk-core
```

## Authentication Types
There are several flavors of authentication supported in this package. To specify the intended authentication pattern to use, the user can pass in the parameter `authentication_type`. This parameter is optional, but it may become required in a future major release. The options for this parameter are `basic`, `iam`, and `icp4d`.

### basic
This indicates Basic Auth is to be used. Users will pass in a `username` and `password` and the SDK will generate a Basic Auth header to send with requests to the service.

### iam
This indicates that IAM token authentication is to be used. Users can pass in an `iam_apikey` or an `iam_access_token`. If an API key is used, the SDK will manage the token for the user. In either case, the SDK will generate a Bearer Auth header to send with requests to the service.

### icp4d
This indicates that the service is an instance of ICP4D, which has its own version of token authentication. Users can pass in a `username` and `password`, or an `icp4d_access_token`. If a username and password is given, the SDK will manage the token for the user.
A `icp4d_url` is **required** for this type. In order to use an SDK-managed token with ICP4D authentication, this option **must** be passed in.
